# Competitions

List of some competitions done in addition to Kaggle competitions.

[**INSA Toulouse - Défi IA - 2019/2020**](https://defi-ia.insa-toulouse.fr)   
Public Leaderboard: 76/87 | Private Leaderboard: 24/87  
*Description: The challenge is to propose automatic methods to detect abnormal changes from helicopter accelerometer signals only from normal (unsupervised) data.*

[**ENS Challenge Data - Optimizing well-being at work (by Oze Energies) - 2019**](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/15)   
Public Leaderboard: 58/123 | Private Leaderboard: 31/123  
*Description: This challenge proposes to develop machine learning based approaches so as to predict individuals' comfort model using several time series of environmental data obtained from sensors in a large building.*

[**ENS Challenge Data - Screening and diagnosis of esophageal cancer from in-vivo microscopy images (by Mauna Kea technologies) - 2019**](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/11)
