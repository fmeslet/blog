{:toc}
This post contains a subjective list of resources I've used to learn Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) from scratch. There are several categories. Only the resources that were useful to me have been cited. There must be other resources available, so I will update it regularly according to my discoveries.
