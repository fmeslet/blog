{:toc}
This post contains a subjective list of resources that I have used to learn Artificial Intelligence from scratch. There are several categories. For each category, the resources are commented by a subjective opinion. Only the resources that were useful to me were cited. There must be other resources available, so I will update it regularly based on my findings.
